- **Family stats** - various stats about a family: number of members, number of alive and dead members, most common trait per age group, and more!
- **Collection tracker** - no more using spreadsheets to track your frog breeding or gardening hybrids!

## Technical Details

Graveyard is being developed using Python 3.9 & Qt.
